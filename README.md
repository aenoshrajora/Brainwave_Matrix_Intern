## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔐 Task 1: Phishing Link Scanner (with GUI)

#### 📖 Description
A **Phishing Link Scanner** that helps users detect potentially malicious URLs before they click on them. It analyzes suspicious links for common phishing indicators and offers an easy-to-use interface.

#### 🛠️ Features
- Scans URLs and detects phishing threats
- Checks for the presence of IP addresses, abnormal URL lengths, and suspicious keywords
- Analyzes domain information and SSL certificate details
- Provides a threat score based on multiple phishing detection parameters
- Simple and intuitive **Tkinter GUI**
- Easy to use with real-time feedback

#### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Tkinter**  
- `requests` and `urllib` for URL handling  
- `whois` for domain analysis

### 🔐 Task 2: Password Strength Checker(with GUI)

#### 📖 Description
A **Password Strength Checker** designed to help users create secure passwords and evaluate the strength of existing ones. It provides analysis and feedback on password quality and includes a customizable password generator.

#### 🛠️ Features
- Real-time password strength analysis
- Detailed feedback and recommendations
- Checks against a list of common passwords
- Password breach check via **HaveIBeenPwned API**
- Customizable password generator *(length, complexity, special characters, etc.)*
- Modern and responsive **Tkinter GUI**

#### 📷 Screenshot
*(Optional: Add your screenshot)*

#### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Tkinter**  
- `zxcvbn` (for password strength estimation)  
- `requests` (for API calls to breach databases)  
- `JSON` & `hashlib`
